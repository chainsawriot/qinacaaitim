# qinacaaitim

This is the book project from me, with the sole aim to "making automated content analysis uncool again".

[So that there is no more hype.]

The title of this project is qinacaaitim. This name is nonsensical, but you could interpret it as "qinacaaitim is not Automated Content Analysis: An Introduction to Its Methodology". I don't want to get sued by either Sage Publications or Professor Klaus Krippendorff, so I want to make sure you know qinacaaitim is not a version of the classical text. But I have an ambition to make this qinacaaitim book a good introduction to the methodology of automated content analysis, the same way the classical c.a.a.i.t.i.m. does to the methodology of content analysis.

It will start as a giant rmarkdown file of my brain dump. Probably later I will need to restructure this as a bookdown project.
